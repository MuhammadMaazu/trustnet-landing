        <hr class="aligncenter mb">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p style="text-align: justify;
          text-justify: inter-word; color:lightgray;">
            <span style="color: red;">COVID-19</span> has changed the way we are currently living our lives and interact
            with others around us. The world
            is not going to be the same again, even when we recover from this pandemic. Today, each of us faces
            life-or-death questions whenever we interact with people, places, or things. These trust issues have become
            even more critical as the government announces lockdowns to be lifted, and life gradually starts to return
            to normal.
            <br /><br />
            The airports and airline industry will need to know who has been cleared to travel domestic or
            international. Hospitals will need a way of knowing which medical professionals and visitors are safe to let
            in. Companies will need to prevent further spread of virus once employees start returning to the office.
            <br /><br />
            Informal trust is essential as a society. But it takes more than just goodwill, common sense, and manners
            when a life-threatening pandemic surrounds us. <b>Governed, digitally provable trust is required</b>, as
            both China
            and South Korea have demonstrated in their countries. Moreover, Bill Gates also observed that: we will need
            “digital certificates to show who has recovered or been tested recently or when we have a vaccine who has
            received it.”
            <br /><br />
            <b><a href="https://trust.net.pk/" target="_blank" style="color: #8EBE46;">TrustNet Pakistan
                Foundation</a>
              has started an open-source <span style="color: red;">COVID-19</span>
              Initiative so we can use blockchain-based digital trust to solve some key problems that we are already
              facing in Pakistan and are likely to occur
              in the post-COVID world.</b> TrustNet PK is already part of a global initiative called <a
              href="https://www.covidcreds.com/" target="_blank" style="color: greenyellow;">‘COVID
              Credentials
              Initiative’</a> which is focused on fighting COVID-19 challenges using blockchain-based digital
            credentials solutions. This initiative is joined by more than 60+ organizations all over the globe with
            more than 200+ people involved.

        <h3 class="centered" style="color: #8a0303;">Why You should Join TrustNet COVID-19 Initiative</h3>
        <hr class="aligncenter mb" style="border-color: #8a0303;">
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
          <p style="text-align: justify;
          text-justify: inter-word; color:black;">
            It is pretty obvious that there will be a pre and post <b><span style="color: red;">COVID</span></b> world.
            The
            question is how we are going to
            remember it. Will we remember it as locked at home and doing nothing about it or using our skills and
            experties for
            something bigger than ourselves and contributing back to society.
            <br /><br />
            <b><i> Using a blockchain-based digital identity trust framework, we can enable healthcare facilities, and
                COVID-19
                testing services all across Pakistan small clinics or big hospitals / labs, to start issuing
                digitally-signed credentials to a
                patient about their COVID-19 status
                directly to their smartphones.
                <br /><br />
                With a quick touchless scan of a QR code, that person can prove that he or she is virus-free or has been
                vaccinated (once that is available). This special digital certificate can maintain the privacy and
                confidentiality of people by having no personal information and still providing strong cryptographic
                proof
                that the credential belongs to that person.
                <br /><br />

                Such a digital credential would be massively harder to fake or spoof than any paper or plastic
                credential.
                And it can be issued in seconds—and revoked in seconds if that individual’s COVID-19 status changes.
                Moreover, its trust interoperability would be international, meaning a digital credential issued in
                Pakistan
                can be verified and trusted anywhere in the world.</i></b>
            <br /><br />
            It is extremely challenging for the digital infrastructure of our society to having integrations with every
            commercial service in the eco-system and have national and international interoperability. We at TrustNet PK
            have a solution for that using the most emerging technology.
            <br /><br />
            The international organizations across the globe have proven the technology and the standards we are using.
            Verifiable digital credential technology is already powering several vital projects, spanning government
            (<a href="https://vonx.io/" target="_blank" style="color: blue;">verifiable
              public directories</a>),
